## Repository Naming

* 2024-06-26: This repo is mainly based on pttbbs. We rename the repo as pttbbs-backend.
* 2022-12-16: The reason why this repo is called go-openbbsmiddleware is because previously the [.NET ASP](https://github.com/Ptt-official-app/AspCoreOpenBBSMiddleware) developers envisioned that the scope of this [middleware](https://hackmd.io/@twbbs/Root#%E6%9E%B6%E6%A7%8B%E5%9C%96) can include other versions of bbs (Maple/中山之島). The naming of this repo followed the naming convention at that time.
